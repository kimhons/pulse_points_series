### CHAPTER 1: SINUS RHYTHM (Eli's POV)
Eli Bennett, a brilliant but compartmentalized cardiologist at Manhattan Memorial, struggles with the pressure of being the son of renowned cardiologist Dr. William Bennett. When he encounters Sophie Winters, a new music therapist implementing an innovative cardiac rehabilitation program, he's skeptical of her methods despite his own hidden musical background. Their first meeting establishes their professional rivalry and sets up the central tension between traditional medicine and complementary approaches.

### CHAPTER 2: DISSONANCE (Sophie's POV)
Sophie Winters begins her first day at Manhattan Memorial, excited to implement her music therapy program but immediately faces resistance from the cardiology department, particularly from Eli Bennett. Despite her dual training in neuroscience and music therapy, she struggles to gain acceptance in the traditional medical environment. The chapter establishes Sophie's determination and scientific approach while highlighting the challenges she faces in a skeptical medical community.

### CHAPTER 3: FORCED COLLABORATION (Eli's POV)
Eli and Sophie are forced to collaborate on a cardiac music therapy research study by the hospital research committee. Their initial professional tension begins to evolve into reluctant scientific respect as they develop the study protocol. Eli struggles with his compartmentalization strategy as he finds himself intellectually engaged with Sophie's scientific approach despite his skepticism about music therapy.

### CHAPTER 4: BASELINE MEASUREMENTS (Sophie's POV)
Sophie meets Eli's friends (Maya, Zoe, and Jackson) during lunch at the hospital cafeteria and learns about his hidden musical talent. She gets her official office near the cardiac rehabilitation area and experiences a brief but meaningful interaction with Eli that shows their growing professional respect.

Increasing moments of connection through their scientific collaboration hint at deeper attraction.

### CHAPTER 6: RESONANCE (Sophie's POV)
Sophie and Eli conduct their first official research session with Mr. Abernathy as their patient, with remarkable results that exceed their expectations.

### CHAPTER 8: CARDIAC EVENT (Sophie's POV)
A medical emergency involving Mr. Abernathy, their research patient, forces Sophie and Eli to work together during a crisis. Eli's father witnesses their successful collaboration and reluctantly acknowledges Sophie's contribution. Their integrated approach leads to an invitation to present at the cardiology department meeting, further developing both their professional partnership and personal connection.

### CHAPTER 9: ARRHYTHMIA (Eli's POV)
Eli and Sophie present their research to the cardiology department, demonstrating their growing professional partnership. Eli's father shows unexpected interest in their collaboration, while Eli continues to struggle with his compartmentalization strategy. The chapter ends with Eli inviting Sophie to lunch, representing a significant boundary adjustment for his carefully separated life.

### CHAPTER 10: COUNTERPOINT (Sophie's POV)
Sophie and Eli have lunch together, discussing their research while developing a more personal connection. Dr. William Bennett interrupts with news that the cardiology department wants a formal collaboration, then later requests a private meeting with Sophie without Eli present. Sophie struggles with how to navigate this situation, ultimately choosing transparency with Eli.

### CHAPTER 11: VENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (Eli's POV)
The climactic medical case unfolds as Eli learns his grandfather has suffered ventricular fibrillation resistant to standard treatments. Eli suggests using their parasympathetic activation research, and Sophie is called in as an emergency consultant. Together, they successfully save Eli's grandfather using their complementary expertise, demonstrating how their professional collaboration has evolved into an effective partnership.

### CHAPTER 12: HARMONIZATION (Sophie's POV)
In the aftermath of the emergency intervention, Sophie and Eli document their work late into the night before sharing a late dinner at a diner, having their first meaningful personal conversation. Maya Rodriguez approaches Sophie about adapting their research for the ER, creating new opportunities for their work. Sophie and Eli complete their formal proposal and make plans for dinner, taking their relationship to the next level.

### CHAPTER 13: INTEGRATION (Eli's POV)
Eli and Sophie's dinner date allows them to continue developing their personal relationship while discussing the evolution of their research. Their work receives approval from the cardiology committee and multi-departmental adoption, including Maya's emergency department. The chapter culminates with Eli's proposal to Sophie, representing his complete reconsideration of his compartmentalization approach to life.

### EPILOGUE: CADENCE (Sophie's POV)
Three months after their marriage, Eli and Sophie present their research at the American College of Cardiology conference, introduced by Dr. William Bennett who has evolved from skeptic to advocate. The epilogue reveals their successful integration of personal and professional lives while setting up Book 3 through their discussion of adapting their research for pediatric applications. The counterpoint metaphor continues as a representation of their relationshipâ€”two distinct voices creating something more beautiful through their interaction than either could produce alone.
