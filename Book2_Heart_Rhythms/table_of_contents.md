**Chapter 1: Sinus Rhythm (Eli's POV)** - Eli Bennett, a brilliant but compartmentalized cardiologist at Manhattan Memorial, struggles with the pressure of being the son of renowned cardiologist Dr. William Bennett. When he encounters Sophie Winters, a new music therapist implementing an innovative cardiac rehabilitation program, he's skeptical of her methods despite his own hidden musical background.

**Chapter 2: Dissonance (Sophie's POV)** - Sophie Winters begins her first day at Manhattan Memorial, excited to implement her music therapy program but immediately faces resistance from the cardiology department, particularly from Eli Bennett. Despite her dual training in neuroscience and music therapy, she struggles to gain acceptance in the traditional medical environment.

**Chapter 3: Forced Collaboration (Eli's POV)** - Eli and Sophie are forced to collaborate on a cardiac music therapy research study by the hospital research committee. Their initial professional tension begins to evolve into reluctant scientific respect as they develop the study protocol.

**Chapter 4: Baseline Measurements (Sophie's POV)** - Sophie meets Eli's friends (Maya, Zoe, and Jackson) during lunch at the hospital cafeteria and learns about his hidden musical talent. She gets her official office near the cardiac rehabilitation area and experiences a brief but meaningful interaction with Eli.

**Chapter 5: Arrhythmia (Eli's POV)** - Eli's father, Dr. William Bennett, is introduced, creating tension and revealing Eli's complex family dynamics. During a department meeting, their research collaboration receives official approval, but Eli struggles with his compartmentalized approach to life.

**Chapter 6: Resonance (Sophie's POV)** - Sophie and Eli conduct their first official research session with Mr. Abernathy as their patient, with remarkable results that exceed their expectations. Sophie gains a deeper understanding of Eli's compartmentalized approach to life.

**Chapter 7: Syncopation (Eli's POV)** - Eli attends Maya's social gathering where Sophie is also present, marking their first interaction outside the hospital setting. He struggles with his compartmentalization strategy as professional and personal domains intersect.

**Chapter 8: Cardiac Event (Sophie's POV)** - A medical emergency involving Mr. Abernathy, their research patient, forces Sophie and Eli to work together during a crisis. Eli's father witnesses their successful collaboration and reluctantly acknowledges Sophie's contribution.

**Chapter 9: Arrhythmia (Eli's POV)** - Eli and Sophie present their research to the cardiology department, demonstrating their growing professional partnership. Eli's father shows unexpected interest in their collaboration, while Eli continues to struggle with his compartmentalization strategy.

**Chapter 10: Counterpoint (Sophie's POV)** - Sophie and Eli have lunch together, discussing their research while developing a more personal connection. Dr. William Bennett interrupts with news that the cardiology department wants a formal collaboration.

**Chapter 11: Ventricular Fibrillation (Eli's POV)** - The climactic medical case unfolds as Eli learns his grandfather has suffered ventricular fibrillation resistant to standard treatments.
