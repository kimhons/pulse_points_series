# COVER DESIGN CONCEPTS FOR "PULSE POINTS" SERIES

Based on 2025 book cover design trends and romance genre conventions, here are suggested cover design concepts for the "Pulse Points" medical romance series.

2. **Seasonal Color Progression**
   - Book 1 (Spring): Fresh greens, soft pinks, and vibrant blues
   - Book 2 (Summer): Warm oranges, bright yellows, and deep blues
   - Book 3 (Fall): Rich burgundies, golden yellows, and forest greens
   - Book 4 (Winter): Cool blues, silvers, and deep purples
