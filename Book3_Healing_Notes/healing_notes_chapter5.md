## CHAPTER 5: CARDIAC CRISIS

The cardiac monitoring lab hummed with the quiet efficiency I preferred—equipment precisely arranged, data displays showing clear parameters, and the absence of unnecessary conversation. The controlled environment with minimal distraction provided optimal conditions through appropriate focus rather than either chaotic activity or complete isolation without suitable balance.

I adjusted the pediatric parameters on the monitoring system with careful precision, calibrating the age-specific thresholds that would track Emma Reyes's cardiac response to Sophie's musical sequence. The developmental considerations with physiological variation required particular attention through specialized settings rather than either adult measurements or general guidelines without appropriate modification.

"Dr. Bennett?"

The unexpected voice created momentary recalibration regarding anticipated solitude beyond mere surprise or standard reaction without particular adjustment. The lab technician with professional demeanor suggested immediate purpose through direct approach rather than either casual greeting or general acknowledgment without specific intention.

The pediatric cardiology wing with distinctive design created immediate recognition through visual elements rather than either gradual identification or uncertain location without clear designation. The specialized environment with child-friendly features maintained medical context through appropriate framework despite colorful decoration or engaging displays without compromised functionality.

The treatment room door stood open, revealing a scene of controlled medical urgency. Emma Reyes lay on the examination table, her small body connected to multiple monitoring devices. Her face, pale beneath her natural olive complexion, showed the wide-eyed fear of a child experiencing something beyond her understanding. Dr. Patel stood beside her, his attention divided between the cardiac monitor and the child herself. A nurse efficiently adjusted medication settings on an IV pump. And Sophie—my Sophie—sat close to Emma's head, speaking in low, calm tones while holding the girl's hand.

The integrated assessment created comprehensive understanding through visual information despite complex situation or multiple elements without verbal explanation. The cardiac event with active management demonstrated ongoing situation through current intervention rather than either resolved episode or standard procedure without particular urgency.

"Dr. Bennett," Dr. Patel acknowledged my arrival with professional efficiency that suggested immediate integration beyond mere greeting or standard recognition without particular focus.
