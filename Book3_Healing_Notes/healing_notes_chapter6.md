# HEALING NOTES

## CHAPTER 6: DEPARTMENTAL PRESENTATION

The pediatric cardiology conference room buzzed with anticipation as I arranged my presentation materials. Unlike the chaotic energy of the ER or the intimate setting of a music therapy session, this space held a different kind of tension—the critical evaluation of peers. I smoothed my blouse and checked the tablet connection to the projector one more time.

"Nervous?" Dr. Rebecca Chen asked, sliding into the seat beside me. The pediatric cardiologist who had initially approached us about adapting our protocol had become a valuable ally over the past weeks.

"A little," I admitted. "It's one thing to present research findings, but quite another to discuss a case that happened yesterday. Especially with Dr. Bennett Senior in attendance."

Rebecca's eyes widened. "William Bennett is coming? That wasn't on the attendance list."

"Apparently he heard about Emma's case and decided to grace us with his presence." I tried to keep the sarcasm from my voice, but Rebecca caught it anyway.

"The great cardiology patriarch descends from on high," she murmured with a knowing smile. "Well, if your protocol can win over Marcus Patel, William Bennett should be a piece of cake."

I wasn't so sure. From everything Eli had shared about his father, William Bennett was a brilliant cardiologist but an impossible man to please. His relationship with Eli was complicated by decades of impossibly high expectations and conditional approval based solely on professional achievement.

The door opened, and Eli entered with Dr. Patel. Their body language had shifted subtly since yesterday's emergency with Emma—still formal, but with a new undercurrent of professional respect. Eli caught my eye and gave me a slight nod, his version of reassurance.

More cardiologists filed in, filling the room with white coats and curious expressions. I recognized a few faces from hospital committees, but most were strangers to me. As a music therapist, I rarely ventured into the cardiology department's inner sanctum.

Dr. Patel moved to the front of the room. "Good morning, colleagues. Today's presentation addresses an innovative approach to managing supraventricular tachycardia in pediatric patients through non-pharmaceutical intervention. Dr. Eli Bennett and Ms. Sophie Bennett will present their research and preliminary findings, including yesterday's successful clinical application."

I noticed he'd used my married name rather than my professional name, Sophie Winters. It was a small thing, but it positioned me as Eli's wife rather than as an independent professional. I pushed down my irritation—this wasn't the time.

Eli stepped forward, his posture perfect as always when presenting. "Thank you, Dr. Patel. Our presentation today outlines the adaptation of our parasympathetic activation sequence for pediatric applications, with specific focus on developmental considerations and age-appropriate modifications."

The door at the back of the room opened, and a tall, distinguished man with silver hair and Eli's jawline entered. The room's energy shifted immediately as several cardiologists straightened in their seats. Dr. William Bennett had arrived.

Eli paused for just a fraction of a second—so brief that only someone who knew him well would notice—before continuing smoothly. "The protocol utilizes precisely calibrated musical sequences to activate parasympathetic response through auditory processing pathways, creating a non-invasive intervention for cardiac rhythm management."

I watched Dr. Bennett Senior take a seat in the back row, his expression impassive as he observed his son. The family resemblance was striking—the same analytical eyes, the same precise movements—but where Eli's features had softened over time through our relationship, his father's remained sharp and evaluating.

As Eli continued outlining the scientific foundation of our work, I prepared for my portion of the presentation. We had decided I would handle the music therapy components and the case study, while Eli covered the cardiac parameters and physiological mechanisms.

"I'll now turn the presentation over to Ms. Winters-Bennett to discuss the music therapy methodology and developmental considerations," Eli said, stepping aside.

I moved to the front, aware of the critical eyes evaluating me. "Thank you, Dr. Bennett. The adaptation of our protocol for pediatric applications required significant modifications to account for developmental stages and age-appropriate engagement strategies."

I clicked to the next slide showing the pediatric music therapy suite. "Unlike adult patients, children process auditory stimuli differently based on their developmental stage. Our approach incorporates these differences through calibrated adjustments to tempo, timbre, and harmonic complexity."

As I explained the methodology, I noticed Dr. Bennett Senior leaning forward slightly, his expression shifting from polite interest to more focused attention. When I reached the slide showing Emma's cardiac parameters during yesterday's intervention, several cardiologists exchanged impressed glances.

"The patient, a seven-year-old female with recurrent SVT, experienced an episode during her initial therapy session," I explained, keeping Emma's identity confidential. "Standard pharmaceutical interventions had previously shown limited effectiveness, with episodes typically requiring emergency department management."

I advanced to the next slide showing the cardiac monitoring data. "As you can see, the implementation of our parasympathetic activation sequence during the active episode produced measurable results within ninety seconds, with complete conversion to normal sinus rhythm achieved at the four-minute mark."

Dr. Patel stepped forward. "I personally observed this intervention and can confirm the accuracy of these results. The patient's heart rate decreased from 210 beats per minute to 88 beats per minute through non-pharmaceutical means alone."

A hand raised in the middle of the room. "Was this a one-time success, or have you replicated these results?"

"This represents our first pediatric application during an active episode," Eli answered, rejoining me at the front. "However, we've documented consistent results in adult populations across multiple episodes and patients. Our research suggests the parasympathetic pathways function similarly in pediatric patients, with appropriate developmental modifications."

Another hand went up. "What about long-term management? Is this intended as an emergency intervention only, or do you envision ongoing application?"

I took this question. "Our protocol includes three components: acute intervention for active episodes, daily practice sequences to establish baseline parasympathetic tone, and preventive applications to reduce episode frequency. The patient has been provided with all three sequences for home use."

The questions continued, each more detailed than the last. The cardiology department was clearly intrigued but appropriately skeptical. I found myself relaxing as we addressed their concerns—this was familiar territory, defending our research with data and methodology rather than promises or theories.

Finally, Dr. Bennett Senior raised his hand. The room fell silent.

"Dr. Bennett," Eli acknowledged, his voice perfectly steady despite the tension I could see in his shoulders.

"The parasympathetic activation through auditory processing represents an interesting approach," the elder Bennett stated, his precise speech patterns so similar to Eli's that I had to suppress a smile. "However, the single-case application with limited follow-up creates insufficient evidence through inadequate sampling despite promising initial results."

I glanced at Eli, wondering how he would respond to his father's challenge. To my surprise, he nodded thoughtfully.

"The preliminary nature with limited data represents acknowledged limitation through appropriate scientific caution," Eli responded. "The research progression with expanded application requires additional cases through continued implementation despite encouraging initial results without premature conclusion."

Dr. Bennett Senior's expression remained neutral, but I caught a flicker of something—approval?—in his eyes. "The pediatric application with developmental consideration creates particular interest through specialized adaptation despite limited precedent or established protocol without comprehensive validation."

It was fascinating watching them interact in this professional setting—two brilliant minds communicating in the same structured pattern, evaluating ideas with clinical precision while maintaining emotional distance. I suddenly understood Eli's compartmentalization strategy much better—he'd learned it from his father.

"If I may," I interjected, "we've designed our research protocol to systematically collect data across multiple pediatric cases with varying cardiac conditions. Dr. Patel has approved the implementation within the pediatric cardiology department, and Dr. Rodriguez is exploring applications in the emergency department."

Dr. Bennett Senior turned his analytical gaze to me. "The music therapy foundation with cardiac application creates unusual partnership through interdisciplinary approach despite traditional separation or conventional division without integrated methodology."

I recognized the question within his statement. "The interdisciplinary collaboration provides comprehensive approach through complementary expertise rather than either isolated specialization or general overview without appropriate synthesis," I replied, adopting their speech pattern deliberately.

A ripple of surprise moved through the room—clearly, few people spoke to William Bennett in his own language. His eyebrows rose slightly, and for a moment, I thought I saw the ghost of a smile.

"The presentation conclusion with implementation plan provides appropriate next steps through structured methodology," Dr. Patel announced, reclaiming control of the meeting. "The pediatric cardiology department with research approval will continue monitoring outcomes through documented protocol despite preliminary stage or initial phase without premature conclusion."

As the presentation ended and the cardiologists began filing out, several approached us with questions and comments. I noticed Dr. Bennett Senior lingering near the door, observing the interactions with an unreadable expression.

"That went well," Rebecca whispered, helping me gather my materials. "You handled the Bennett men beautifully."

"Years of practice with one, first time with the other," I replied with a small smile.

"Dr. William Bennett rarely attends departmental presentations unless he's the one presenting," she noted. "His appearance today speaks volumes about his interest in your work—or perhaps his interest in his son's work."

Before I could respond, Eli approached with Dr. Patel. "The presentation reception with colleague engagement demonstrated positive response through active participation despite initial skepticism or preliminary reservation without appropriate evidence," Eli observed.

Dr. Patel nodded. "The protocol explanation with documented outcome provided compelling demonstration through empirical evidence despite single case or limited sample without statistical significance."

I was about to respond when I noticed Dr. Bennett Senior approaching. Eli straightened almost imperceptibly.

"The parasympathetic activation with cardiac application demonstrates innovative approach through interdisciplinary methodology despite conventional treatment or traditional intervention without established precedent," the elder Bennett stated, his gaze moving between Eli and me. "The collaborative research with complementary expertise provides comprehensive development through integrated knowledge rather than either separate contribution or parallel development without coordinated approach."

Coming from William Bennett, this was effusive praise. Eli's expression remained composed, but I could see the impact of his father's words in the slight relaxation of his shoulders.

"The protocol development with clinical application represents continued research through established methodology despite new direction or innovative approach without abandoned foundation," Eli responded, acknowledging his father's influence on his work.

Dr. Bennett Senior turned to me. "The music therapy integration with cardiac parameters creates particular interest through specialized application despite unconventional approach or innovative methodology without established precedent."

"The interdisciplinary collaboration with complementary expertise provides optimal development through integrated knowledge," I replied. "The pediatric adaptation with developmental consideration demonstrates expanded application through specialized modification despite original design or initial framework without fundamental redesign."

He studied me for a moment longer than was comfortable. "The Bennett dinner with family gathering occurs Sunday evening through established arrangement despite professional context or hospital setting without continued discussion."

With that invitation—or command—delivered, he nodded to Dr. Patel and departed, leaving a wake of silence behind him.

"Did he just...invite us to dinner?" I asked Eli once his father was out of earshot.

"The family dinner with parental invitation represents unusual development through unexpected communication despite established pattern or typical behavior without previous occurrence," Eli confirmed, his expression showing rare surprise.

Dr. Patel looked between us with newfound interest. "The senior Bennett with dinner invitation demonstrates significant evolution through unprecedented behavior despite established reputation or known character without previous example."

"Is that good or bad?" I asked, abandoning the structured speech pattern.

Eli considered this. "Uncertain. The family interaction with professional context creates complex situation through multiple dimensions despite apparent simplicity or straightforward invitation without explicit purpose."

Rebecca patted my arm sympathetically. "Welcome to the Bennett family dynamics. I've worked with William for years, and I still can't predict his reactions."

As we left the conference room, Eli remained unusually quiet. I knew him well enough to recognize when he was processing something significant. The invitation from his father had disrupted his carefully compartmentalized world in a way that our marriage and even our research collaboration hadn't.

"You don't have to accept the invitation," I said quietly as we walked toward the research lab. "We can make an excuse."

Eli shook his head. "The parental relationship with professional connection creates necessary engagement through appropriate response despite personal complexity or emotional challenge without suitable alternative."

I took his hand, a rare public display of affection in the hospital setting. "We'll face it together, then. I've handled one Bennett man; I can handle another."

His fingers tightened around mine briefly before he released them as we entered the more populated main corridor. "The shared experience with mutual support provides optimal approach through collaborative engagement rather than either individual management or separate handling without integrated response."

The rest of the day passed in a blur of research documentation, patient consultations, and preparation for our next pediatric case. Emma Reyes was scheduled for a follow-up appointment the next day, and we needed to analyze her response to the home sequences she'd been using.

By late afternoon, I found myself in the pediatric music therapy suite, adjusting instruments and reviewing session plans for the following day. The colorful room with its child-sized furniture and carefully selected instruments created a stark contrast to the sterile conference room where we'd presented that morning.

A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. Maya Rodriguez leaned against the doorframe, her scrubs wrinkled from a long shift in the ER.

"I heard your presentation was the talk of the cardiology department," she said with a grin. "And that the great William Bennett himself made an appearance."

"News travels fast," I observed, gesturing for her to come in.

"Hospital grapevine," Maya shrugged, dropping into one of the adult-sized chairs. "So, dinner with the in-laws? That's a big step."

I raised an eyebrow. "The grapevine is particularly efficient today."

"I ran into Eli in the cafeteria. He mentioned it while looking like he'd swallowed something unpleasant." Maya stretched her legs out in front of her. "For what it's worth, I think it's a good sign. William Bennett doesn't waste time on people or ideas he doesn't find valuable."

"That's what worries me," I admitted. "Is he interested in our research, or is he finally acknowledging his son's marriage?"

Maya considered this. "Probably both. The Bennetts aren't great at separating personal and professional—despite Eli's best efforts to compartmentalize everything into neat little boxes."

"You've known Eli longer than I have," I said. "What was he like before we met?"

Maya's expression softened with fond remembrance. "Brilliant, focused, and completely closed off emotionally. He was respected by everyone but close to almost no one. Even our friendship group—me, Zoe, Jackson—we were his colleagues first, friends second."

"And now?"

"Now he's still brilliant and focused, but there's more to him. He laughs sometimes. He joins conversations that aren't about medicine. He looks at you like you're the most fascinating research subject he's ever encountered." Maya smiled. "You've been good for him, Sophie."

"He's been good for me too," I said quietly. "He grounds me when I get too caught up in possibilities rather than practicalities."

Maya leaned forward, her expression turning serious. "Speaking of possibilities, I wanted to talk to you about expanding the pediatric protocol to the ER. We get a lot of kids with SVT and other arrhythmias, often in crisis situations where standard medications aren't working or have significant side effects."

"That would be a challenging environment for music therapy," I noted. "The ER isn't exactly conducive to focused listening or relaxation techniques."

"That's why I need your expertise," Maya countered. "We need to adapt the protocol for high-stress, high-noise environments. Maybe headphones, or a modified sequence that works faster."

I considered the possibilities. "We could develop a more intensive sequence specifically for emergency situations. The parasympathetic activation could be accelerated with certain harmonic progressions and rhythmic patterns."

"Exactly!" Maya's eyes lit up with enthusiasm. "This could revolutionize how we handle pediatric cardiac emergencies. Less medication, fewer side effects, better outcomes."

"I'd need to work with you to understand the specific constraints and requirements of the ER setting," I said, already mentally sketching out potential modifications. "And we'd need to conduct controlled trials before implementing it in actual emergencies."

"Of course," Maya agreed. "But after seeing what happened with Emma yesterday, I'm convinced this approach has enormous potential. Dr. Foster is interested too—anything that improves outcomes while reducing costs gets his attention."

The mention of the hospital administrator brought me back to practical considerations. "We'd need additional funding for the research and implementation. Our current grant doesn't cover ER applications."

"Leave that to me and Foster," Maya said confidently. "You focus on the protocol development. Between the cardiology department's interest and the ER's practical needs, we should be able to secure the necessary resources."

As Maya left to return to her shift, I found myself energized by the possibilities. The expansion to the ER represented yet another evolution of our work, reaching more patients in more critical situations. It was exactly the kind of meaningful application I'd hoped for when Eli and I first began our collaboration.

I was still contemplating the ER adaptation when Eli arrived at the music therapy suite an hour later. His expression was more open than it had been after the presentation, suggesting he'd processed his father's invitation and reached some kind of resolution.

"The research documentation with protocol modification demonstrates significant progress through comprehensive development despite recent presentation or departmental focus without delayed advancement," he observed, looking over the notes I'd been making.

"Maya visited," I explained. "She's interested in adapting our protocol for the ER, specifically for pediatric cardiac emergencies."

Eli's expression showed genuine interest. "The emergency application with critical context creates valuable expansion through practical implementation despite challenging environment or difficult conditions without optimal setting."

"That's what I thought too," I agreed. "It would require significant modifications to account for the noise, stress, and time constraints, but the potential benefits are substantial."

"The protocol adaptation with environmental consideration provides interesting challenge through technical requirements despite implementation complexity or practical limitations without insurmountable obstacles," Eli noted, already analyzing the problem with his characteristic precision.

We spent the next hour discussing potential modifications, our conversation flowing seamlessly between technical details and practical applications. This was what I loved about working with Eli—the way our different perspectives created something neither of us could have developed alone. His analytical precision complemented my intuitive creativity, producing innovations that were both scientifically sound and practically effective.

"The workday conclusion with evening approach suggests appropriate transition through scheduled progression despite engaging discussion or interesting development without extended continuation," Eli eventually observed, glancing at his watch.

I smiled at his characteristic way of suggesting we go home. "You're right. We can continue this tomorrow after Emma's follow-up appointment."

As we gathered our materials and prepared to leave, Eli paused. "The dinner invitation with parental interaction creates particular consideration through unusual development despite professional context or research focus without expected occurrence."

I understood his concern. "We'll handle it together. Your father may be intimidating, but he's just a person with his own perspectives and priorities. And regardless of how the dinner goes, it doesn't change our work or our relationship."

Eli considered this. "The compartmentalized approach with separate domains demonstrates previous strategy through established pattern despite integrated development or connected aspects without appropriate evolution."

"Are you saying you're reconsidering your compartmentalization strategy?" I asked, surprised by this potential shift in his fundamental approach to life.

"The rigid separation with distinct categories creates potential limitation through artificial boundaries despite organizational benefit or structural advantage without optimal flexibility," he acknowledged. "The integrated approach with balanced connection provides alternative consideration through evolving perspective despite established pattern or familiar method without immediate conclusion."

Coming from Eli, this was a significant admission. His compartmentalization strategy had been a core aspect of his personality and coping mechanism for as long as I'd known him. The fact that he was even considering a more integrated approach represented profound personal growth.

"That's a big step," I said gently. "Integration doesn't mean eliminating all boundaries—it just means allowing more connection between different aspects of your life when it makes sense to do so."

Eli nodded thoughtfully. "The balanced approach with appropriate boundaries demonstrates optimal functioning through suitable framework rather than either rigid separation or complete merger without distinct domains."

"Exactly," I agreed. "And speaking of balance, what do you think about stopping at that new Thai place on the way home? I'm starving, and we deserve a celebration after that presentation."

The shift to a more personal, everyday topic seemed to relax him. "The dinner suggestion with specific cuisine creates positive anticipation through appealing option despite unfamiliar restaurant or new location without previous experience."

As we left the hospital and headed toward the restaurant, I reflected on the day's developments. The successful presentation, William Bennett's unexpected invitation, Maya's proposal for the ER adaptation, and now Eli's reconsideration of his compartmentalization strategy—each represented a significant evolution in our professional and personal lives.

The Thai restaurant was small but inviting, with warm lighting and delicious aromas. We were seated in a quiet corner booth, the privacy allowing Eli to relax more fully than he typically did in public settings.

"To successful presentations and unexpected dinner invitations," I said, raising my water glass in a mock toast.

Eli's lips curved in a small smile as he tapped his glass against mine. "The professional achievement with personal development creates satisfying experience through balanced outcome despite challenging aspects or unexpected elements without negative impact."

"I'm curious about something," I said as we looked over the menu. "Your father speaks in exactly the same pattern you do. Is that where you learned it?"

Eli considered this. "The speech pattern with structured framework represents family characteristic through established communication despite individual variation or personal adaptation without fundamental difference."

"So it's a Bennett family trait," I observed. "I noticed you use it more in professional settings or when processing complex emotions. Is that deliberate?"

"The structured communication with organized framework provides clarity through systematic expression despite emotional complexity or situational challenge without appropriate alternative," he explained. "The family origin with childhood development created established pattern through formative influence despite adult independence or personal evolution without complete separation."

I reached across the table to take his hand. "Thank you for sharing that. It helps me understand both you and your father better."

His fingers intertwined with mine, a gesture that had become more natural for him over time. "The personal sharing with intimate communication demonstrates relationship evolution through increased openness despite private nature or reserved tendency without complete transformation."

"I love you too," I translated with a smile.

The waiter arrived to take our order, temporarily pausing our conversation. Once he departed, Eli returned to the topic of his father.

"The dinner invitation with family context creates uncertain expectation through ambiguous purpose despite clear communication or explicit arrangement without stated intention," he noted, the concern evident beneath his structured language.

"What do you think he wants?" I asked directly.

Eli considered this. "The potential motivations with multiple possibilities create several hypotheses through logical analysis despite insufficient data or limited information without definitive conclusion."

"Such as?"

"The research interest with professional evaluation represents primary hypothesis through probable motivation despite personal context or family setting without exclusive focus," he began. "The marital acknowledgment with relationship recognition provides secondary consideration through possible intention despite delayed timing or postponed acceptance without appropriate promptness."

"And the third possibility?" I prompted, sensing there was more.

Eli hesitated. "The family planning with generational consideration creates tertiary hypothesis through potential interest despite personal nature or private matter without appropriate boundary."

I nearly choked on my water. "You think your father invited us to dinner to ask about grandchildren?"

"The possibility exists through logical consideration despite unlikely probability or reduced likelihood without complete dismissal," Eli acknowledged, his discomfort evident in his even more structured speech.

"Well, that would be an interesting dinner conversation," I said, trying to lighten the mood. "Though given our recent discussions on the topic, perhaps not entirely unwelcome?"

Eli's expression softened. "The family consideration with appropriate timing demonstrates mutual interest through shared discussion despite private nature or personal decision without external influence."

"Exactly," I agreed. "Whatever your father's motivations, we'll handle them together. Our decisions are our own, made in our own time."

The arrival of our food provided a welcome shift in conversation. We spent the rest of the meal discussing Emma's case, the potential ER adaptation, and our plans for the weekend before the Sunday dinner with his parents.

By the time we arrived home, the tension from the day had largely dissipated. Our apartment welcomed us with familiar comfort—the perfect blend of Eli's organized precision and my more creative touches. The living room bookshelf held medical journals alongside music theory texts, while the kitchen combined Eli's methodically arranged spice rack with my collection of mismatched mugs.

"The home environment with shared space demonstrates integrated life through combined elements despite different preferences or separate styles without compromised harmony," Eli observed as he hung up his coat.

"It's a good metaphor for our relationship," I agreed. "Different but complementary, creating something better together than either could alone."

As we settled into our evening routine, I found myself contemplating the future—both immediate and long-term. The dinner with Eli's parents represented a significant milestone in our relationship, potentially bridging the gap between Eli's professional relationship with his father and our personal life together.

More broadly, our work was evolving in exciting new directions. The pediatric adaptation had opened doors we hadn't anticipated, creating opportunities to help more patients in more critical situations. And our personal discussions about family planning had taken on new dimension through our work with children like Emma.

Later, as we prepared for bed, Eli seemed lost in thought. "The professional development with personal consideration creates interesting parallel through connected elements despite separate domains or distinct aspects without inappropriate merger," he finally said.

"You mean how our work with pediatric patients relates to our discussions about having children?" I asked, understanding his meaning despite the structured language.

He nodded. "The professional experience with child interaction provides additional perspective through practical exposure despite different context or separate role without identical situation."

"It's natural for our work to influence our personal considerations," I acknowledged. "Working with Emma and seeing the impact of our intervention—it makes the abstract concept of parenthood more concrete."

"The family planning with thoughtful consideration demonstrates appropriate approach through careful deliberation despite emotional component or significant impact without impulsive decision," Eli agreed.

I sat beside him on the edge of the bed. "I think we're moving toward readiness, Eli. Our research is established, our professional positions are secure, and our relationship provides the stability a child needs."

His expression showed both vulnerability and resolution. "The shared decision with mutual determination provides optimal approach through collaborative choice rather than either individual preference or separate consideration without integrated conclusion."

"So we're officially trying?" I asked, wanting absolute clarity on this important decision.

Eli took my hand, his touch gentle but certain. "The family expansion with parental role represents mutual objective through shared decision despite significant change or substantial adjustment without inappropriate concern."

I smiled, translating his structured language into the emotional commitment it represented. "I love you, Eli Bennett. You're going to be an amazing father."

"The parental capability with effective function represents uncertain prediction through hopeful projection despite limited experience or absent practice without established evidence," he replied, but his eyes conveyed what his structured language couldn't fully express—love, hope, and a touch of fear at the unknown territory ahead.

"We'll learn together," I assured him, leaning in to kiss him softly. "Just like we've done with everything else."

As we settled into bed, the events of the day receded into proper perspective. The successful presentation, William Bennett's unexpected invitation, Maya's proposal for the ER adaptation—all were important developments in our professional lives. But this moment, this decision between us, represented something even more significant: the potential beginning of our family.

The counterpoint of our lives continued its beautiful development, our independent melodies creating harmony through integration rather than either complete division or forced uniformity. The music played on with remarkable beauty, each new movement building on the themes established before while introducing variations that created depth and richness to the ongoing composition.

With Eli's steady breathing beside me as he drifted toward sleep, I allowed myself to imagine the future—our research expanding to help more patients, our family growing to include children, our lives continuing to evolve in ways both expected and surprising. The possibilities created a lullaby of their own, carrying me gently into dreams filled with music, medicine, and the family we might soon begin.
